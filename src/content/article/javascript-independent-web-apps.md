In today's digital era, where advanced web applications reign supreme, it is crucial to prioritize accessibility and usability for users in different scenarios. A key factor in achieving this is ensuring that the fundamental functionalities of a web application work seamlessly, even when JavaScript is turned off. In this article, we will explore the significance of this aspect and discover how SvelteKit can effortlessly help you achieve it.

### Why Web Apps Should Function Without JavaScript?

1. **Enhancing Accessibility and Inclusivity**:
   A considerable proportion of individuals who use the internet rely on assistive technologies that may not fully support JavaScript. By developing web applications that can function without JavaScript, we can create a more inclusive online experience, catering to a wider range of users.

2. **Optimizing SEO and Search Engine Indexing**:
   Search engines often face challenges in indexing content within web applications that heavily rely on JavaScript. Ensuring that essential features can work without JavaScript enhances search engine visibility and overall performance in terms of search engine optimization (SEO), ultimately leading to improved discoverability.

3. **Boosting Performance on Low-End Devices**:
   Certain devices or browsers may lack the necessary processing power to smoothly handle complex JavaScript operations. By allowing core functionalities to operate without relying on JavaScript, we effectively optimize performance for these devices, resulting in an enhanced user experience.

4. **Ensuring Compatibility with Older Browsers and Devices**:
   Older browsers or devices might not support the latest functionalities offered by JavaScript technology. By enabling core features to function independently from JavaScript, we ensure compatibility and enable users utilizing older technology to still access and utilize the application efficiently.

### How SvelteKit Enables JavaScript-Independent Functionality?

[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev) is a modern web application framework that allows you to build highly interactive and dynamic single-page applications (SPAs). However, it provides the capability to build web apps that can perform essential tasks such as rendering data and submitting data even without JavaScript. [Rich Harris](https://twitter.com/Rich_Harris), the developer and caretaker of Svelte and SvelteKit, adheres to this fundamental principle in all his creations. It serves as his guiding philosophy.

Here's how SvelteKit ensures the above concept:

- **Hybrid Approach:** SvelteKit adopts a unique strategy that combines server-side rendering (SSR) for the first page loads and effortlessly switches to a client-side application for subsequent interactions. Making web apps work just like modern single-page applications.

- **Ensuring Server-rendered Content as Backup:** To ensure that important content is still accessible when JavaScript is disabled, SvelteKit renders essential content on the server initially and handles data post-processing in a manner reminiscent of PHP. This guarantees that crucial features remain fully functional regardless of the user's JS settings.

### Experience It Yourself

### Conclusion

Prioritizing the functionality of core features without JavaScript is a testament to a web app's resilience and commitment to inclusivity. With SvelteKit, achieving this goal becomes effortless, enhancing accessibility, SEO, and user experience. Embrace the hybrid approach, ensure essential functionality always works, and build a web app that truly caters to all users.
